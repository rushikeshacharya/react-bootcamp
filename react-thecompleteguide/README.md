## React

- React is not a framework, its a JS Library for UI.
- Will work more on Functional Components and less on Class based component
-


### Component
- Component in React is just a JS function
- Reusability
- Separation of concerns (functions)

- JSX - Javascript XML
- You should have only one root JSX element while returning

### Props And Components

Note: Never mutate the state directly

### State and Hooks

- useState

React Plugins

- React Icons
- React Strap
- React Tostify

`Note:` Always use bootsrap import first and then our own css imports

### Context API

- React.createContext
- Context.Provider
- Context.consumer
